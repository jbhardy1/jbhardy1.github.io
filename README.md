# web-portfolio
A simple web-portfolio developed using Vite + Vue.Js. This is still in progress, and not a complete project.

## Features
A home page with navigation links and animated tech stack container.
An about page with a tabbed container for navigation, featuring information about me, my education, and my technical experience.
A project page featuring live and demo projects I've completed. It describes the project, lists the technologies used to develop, and names any collaborators for the project.
